Required Inputs:
beginning and end locations (x,y,z)
boundaries (x and y planes)
obstacles (x,y locations and size(?))

Optional Inputs:
Modular or not
sunk posts or not
ramp width
porch exists (true false)
ramp ends on dirt or concrete

Necessary functionality:
Take inputs and generate a possible ramp path using a pathfinding algorithm
Have path be user adjustable
Have an interactive grid for selecting the start/end, boundary planes, and obstacle locations, able to adjust path from here by click/drag
