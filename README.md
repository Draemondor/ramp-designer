For starters, make sure that jdk 11.06 is installed (at least) as well as JavaFX 11 JDK

To run this software, it is recommended to install Intellij IDE. The rest of the installation guide will be refering to intelliJ specific features 
and setup components. 

Once intelliJ is isntalled, clone this repository from the terminal with your typicaly git commands. (Google how to clone a repository from github)

Next, run intelliJ and open the project you just cloned. (fronm the root directory)

If a popup shows asking to impoort gradle stuff, allow this.

On the right hand side of the intelliJ editor, click on Gradle (It will appear as a 90 degree oriented tab on the far right hand side).
From the dropdown, click Tasks, then build, then double click build. Next, From the the Tasks root once more, go inside applications directory, 
and douible click run.

The applicatoin should then run through IntelliJ IDE
